How to run the game:
Sorry, but you need to use vsc (Visual Studio Code)

---------------------------------------------

1. Open the HTML file in  VSC

2. If you haven't already, install the "Live Server" extention for Visual Studio code (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
  
3. Press the 'Go Live' button in the bottom right

4. Play the game!

---------------------------------------------

Possible errors and solutions:

- "Open a folder or workspace"
  This means you opened the file in VSC incorrectly, and Live Server cannot access it. You can easily fix this by pressing file, open folder/open file, and select the html file or the folder its in.
Now you should be able to run it, no issues.
